## Getting a Thunderstore token

Check the wiki [here](https://github.com/GreenTF/upload-thunderstore-package/wiki#where-to-get-your-thunderstore-token)

## Finding the available categories

Figuring out how to refer to your community's categories can be somewhat confusing. 

To find the categories available to your community, check out `https://thunderstore.io/api/experimental/community/YOUR_COMMUNITY/category/`, which will return a list of categories in a JSON format. Each category will have a `name` value and a `slug` value. The `slug` is the value you need to put in the `categories` list of the action.

### Example
On Linux with `jq` installed:
 
```bash
curl -X GET "https://thunderstore.io/api/experimental/community/northstar/category/" -H  "accept: application/json" | jq # 'jq' is a command line utility that formats JSON
```
```json5
{
  "pagination": {
    "next_link": null,
    "previous_link": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Models",
      "slug": "models"
    },
    {
      "name": "Maps",
      "slug": "maps"
    },
    // a bunch of others...
  ]
}
```
